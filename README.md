# Fake News Detection 
 
Fake News Detection in Python
  
In this project, I have applied a range of natural language processing techniques and machine learning algorithms to classify fake news articles. The project utilizes Pythonâ€™s Scikit-learn library, which provides a robust framework for implementing and optimizing machine learning models. Through preprocessing, feature extraction, and model training, I have developed an efficient system for identifying and categorizing news content, enabling automated detection of misinformation.
 
## Getting Started
 
These instructions will get a copy of the project up and running on the local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.
 
### Prerequisites

What things we need to install the software and how to install them:

1. Python 3.6 
   - This setup requires that your machine has python 3.6 installed on it. we can refer to this url https://www.python.org/downloads/ to download python. Once we have python downloaded and installed, we will need to setup PATH variables (if we want to run python program directly, detail instructions are below in *how to run software section*). To do that we can check this: https://www.pythoncentral.io/add-python-to-path-python-is-not-recognized-as-an-internal-or-external-command/.  
   - Setting up PATH variable is optional as we can also run program without it and more instruction are given below on this topic. 
2. Second and easier option is to download anaconda and use its anaconda prompt to run the commands. To install anaconda I am checking this url https://www.anaconda.com/download/
3. I will also need to download and install below 3 packages after I install either python or anaconda from the steps above
   - Sklearn (scikit-learn)
   - numpy
   - scipy
   
  - if we have chosen to install python 3.6 then run below commands in command prompt/terminal to install these packages
   ```
   pip install -U scikit-learn
   pip install numpy
   pip install scipy
   ```
   - if we have chosen to install anaconda then run below commands in anaconda prompt to install these packages
   ```
   conda install -c scikit-learn
   conda install -c anaconda numpy
   conda install -c anaconda scipy
   ```   

#### Dataset used
The data source used for this project is LIAR dataset which contains 3 files with .tsv format for test, train and validation. Below is some description about the data files used for this project.
	
LIAR: A BENCHMARK DATASET FOR FAKE NEWS DETECTION

William Yang Wang, "Liar, Liar Pants on Fire": A New Benchmark Dataset for Fake News Detection, to appear in Proceedings of the 55th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL 2017), short paper, Vancouver, BC, Canada, July 30-August 4, ACL.

the original dataset contained 13 variables/columns for train, test and validation sets as follows:

* Column 1: the ID of the statement ([ID].json).
* Column 2: the label. (Label class contains: True, Mostly-true, Half-true, Barely-true, FALSE, Pants-fire)
* Column 3: the statement.
* Column 4: the subject(s).
* Column 5: the speaker.
* Column 6: the speaker's job title.
* Column 7: the state info.
* Column 8: the party affiliation.
* Column 9-13: the total credit history count, including the current statement.
* 9: barely true counts.
* 10: false counts.
* 11: half true counts.
* 12: mostly true counts.
* 13: pants on fire counts.
* Column 14: the context (venue / location of the speech or statement).

To make things simple we have chosen only 2 variables from this original dataset for this classification. The other variables can be added later to add some more complexity and enhance the features.

Below are the columns used to create 3 datasets that have been in used in this project
* Column 1: Statement (News headline or text).
* Column 2: Label (Label class contains: True, False)
 
We will see that newly created dataset has only 2 classes as compared to 6 from original classes. Below is method used for reducing the number of classes.

* Original 	--	New
* True	   	--	True
* Mostly-true	-- 	True
* Half-true	-- 	True
* Barely-true	-- 	False
* False		-- 	False
* Pants-fire	-- 	False

The dataset used for this project were in csv format named train.csv, test.csv and valid.csv and can be found in repo. The original datasets are in "liar" folder in tsv format.


### File descriptions

#### DataPrep.py
This file contains all the pre processing functions needed to process all input documents and texts. First we read the train, test and validation data files then performed some pre processing like tokenizing, stemming etc. There are some exploratory data analysis is performed like response variable distribution and data quality checks like null or missing values etc.

#### FeatureSelection.py
In this file I have performed feature extraction and selection methods from sci-kit learn python libraries. For feature selection, I have used methods like simple bag-of-words and n-grams and then term frequency like tf-tdf weighting. I have also used word2vec and POS tagging to extract the features, though POS tagging and word2vec has not been used at this point in the project.

#### classifier.py
Here I have build all the classifiers for predicting the fake news detection. The extracted features are fed into different classifiers. I have used Naive-bayes, Logistic Regression, Linear SVM, Stochastic gradient descent and Random forest classifiers from sklearn. Each of the extracted features were used in all of the classifiers. Once fitting the model, we compared the f1 score and checked the confusion matrix. After fitting all the classifiers, 2 best performing models were selected as candidate models for fake news classification. We have performed parameter tuning by implementing GridSearchCV methods on these candidate models and chosen best performing parameters for these classifier. Finally selected model was used for fake news detection with the probability of truth. In Addition to this, I have also extracted the top 50 features from our term-frequency tfidf vectorizer to see what words are most and important in each of the classes. I have also used Precision-Recall and learning curves to see how training and test set performs when we increase the amount of data in our classifiers.

#### prediction.py
My finally selected and best performing classifier was ```Logistic Regression``` which was then saved on disk with name ```final_model.sav```. Once I close this repository, this model will be copied to user's machine and will be used by prediction.py file to classify the fake news. It takes an news article as input from user then model is used for final classification output that is shown to user along with probability of truth.

### Next steps
As we can see that our best performing models had an f1 score in the range of 70's. This is due to less number of data that I have used for training purposes and simplicity of my models. For the future implementations, we could introduce some more feature selection methods such as POS tagging, word2vec and topic modeling. In addition, we could also increase the training data size. I will extend this project to implement these techniques in future to increase the accuracy and performance of my models.


### Installing and steps to run the software

A step by step series of examples that tells to get a development env running

1. The first step would be to clone this repo in a folder in the local machine. To do that we need to run following command in command prompt or in git bash
```
$ git clone https://github.com/nishitpatel01/Fake_News_Detection.git
```

2. This will copy all the data source file, program files and model into our machine.

3.
   - If we have chosen to install anaconda then follow below instructions
     - After all the files are saved in a folder in our machine. If we chosen to install anaconda from the steps given in 	               ```Prerequisites``` sections then open the anaconda prompt, change the directory to the folder where this project is saved in     our machine and type below command and press enter.
	```
	cd C:/your cloned project folder path goes here/
	```
     - Once we are inside the directory call the ```prediction.py``` file, To do this, run below command in anaconda prompt.
	```
	python prediction.py
	```
     - After hitting the enter, program will ask for an input which will be a piece of information or a news headline that you 	    	   want to verify. Once you paste or type news headline, then press enter.

     - Once you hit the enter, program will take user input (news headline) and will be used by model to classify in one of  categories of "True" and "False". Along with classifying the news headline, model will also provide a probability of truth associated with it.

4.  If we choose to install python (and did not set up PATH variable for it) then follow below instructions:
    - After we clone the project in a folder in our machine. Open command prompt and change the directory to project directory by running below command.
    ```
    cd C:/your cloned project folder path goes here/
    ```
    - Locate ```python.exe``` in your machine. we can search this in window explorer search bar. 
    - Once we locate the ```python.exe``` path, we need to write whole path of it and then entire path of project folder with ```prediction.py``` at the end. For example if our ```python.exe``` is located at ```c:/Python36/python.exe``` and project folder is at ```c:/users/user_name/desktop/fake_news_detection/```, then our command to run program will be as below:
    ```
    c:/Python36/python.exe C:/users/user_name/desktop/fake_news_detection/prediction.py
    ```
    - After hitting the enter, program will ask for an input which will be a piece of information or a news headline that we 	    	   want to verify. Once we paste or type news headline, then press enter.

    - Once we hit the enter, program will take user input (news headline) and will be used by model to classify in one of  categories of "True" and "False". Along with classifying the news headline, model will also provide a probability of truth associated with it. It might take few seconds for model to classify the given statement so wait for it.

5.  If we choose to install python (and already setup PATH variable for ```python.exe```) then follow instructions:
    - Open the command prompt and change the directory to project folder as mentioned in above by running below command
    ```
    cd C:/our cloned project folder path/
    ```
    - run below command
    ```
    python.exe C:/our cloned project folder path/
    ```
    - After hitting the enter, program will ask for an input which will be a piece of information or a news headline that I 	    	   want to verify. Once I paste or type news headline, then press enter.

    - Once I hit the enter, program will take user input (news headline) and will be used by model to classify in one of  categories of "True" and "False". Along with classifying the news headline, model will also provide a probability of truth associated with it.

## Pros

- **Accurate Classification:** Utilizes NLP techniques and machine learning algorithms for effective fake news detection.
- **Scalable:** The system can be easily expanded to handle larger datasets or additional features.
- **Automated Process:** Automates the detection of fake news, saving time and reducing human intervention.
- **Open-Source Libraries:** Leverages Scikit-learn and other open-source libraries, making it easy to implement and extend.
- **Customizable:** Allows customization of models, preprocessing steps, and features for different use cases.
- **Versatile:** Can be applied to various types of text data, including articles, social media posts, etc.

## Cons

- **Data Dependency:** Model performance heavily relies on the quality and size of the training data.
- **Overfitting Risk:** Without proper tuning, models may overfit to training data, leading to poor generalization on unseen data.
- **Bias in Training Data:** The model might inherit biases from the training data, potentially leading to incorrect classifications.
- **Feature Engineering:** Requires careful feature extraction and selection, which can be time-consuming and complex.
- **Limited to Textual Data:** The system works only with textual data and does not account for other forms of misinformation (e.g., images, videos).
- **Model Interpretability:** Some machine learning models, like deep learning models, can be difficult to interpret, making it harder to understand why certain news is classified as fake or real.
